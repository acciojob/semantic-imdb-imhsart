		<section id='actor'><h3>About the Actor</h3><span class='actor-section'>Matthew McConaughey</span>, as Joseph "Coop" Cooper, a widowed NASA pilot who reluctantly becomes a farmer after the agency was closed by the government, and eventually joins the Endurance mission as the lead pilot. Matthew McConaughey plays Joseph Cooper, a former NASA pilot turned farmer, and his performance is the emotional backbone of Interstellar. Cooper isn’t just a space explorer chasing science — he’s a father torn apart by love for his children, especially Murph. When he leaves Earth to find a new home for humanity, he knows he may never see them again, and that sacrifice defines his journey. McConaughey brings a rare mix of calm intelligence and raw vulnerability to the role: the quiet confidence of a pilot, the curiosity of a scientist, and the heartbreak of a parent watching time steal his relationship with his kids. His scenes—especially those involving messages from Earth—are some of the most emotionally devastating moments in modern sci-fi.</section>
		<section id='quote'><h3>Quote section</h3>At its core, Interstellar is about time, love, and human perseverance, wrapped in the language of physics and space. The film suggests that while time is a rigid, unforgiving force, love is something that can transcend dimensions and logic. One of its most memorable ideas comes from the line: “Love is the one thing we’re capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space.” The lesson isn’t anti-science; it’s deeply human. Progress, survival, and discovery matter—but without love, they’re empty. The movie quietly reminds us that sometimes the most powerful force pushing humanity forward isn’t equations or technology, but the emotional bonds that give those discoveries meaning.</section>
